#13. A user enters two integer numbers from the keyboard. Write a program that checks whether at least one of them is not negative. Sample result:
#Enter number 1: 25
#Enter number 2: -17
#At least one of entered numbers 25 and -17 is not negative

number1 = int(input('Enter number 1: '))
number2 = int(input('Enter number 2: '))

if number1 >= 0 or number2 >= 0:
    print(f'At least one of entered numbers {number1} and {number2} is not negative')
